# Footer Component Tests

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the Footer component, specifically focusing on the hydration fix implementation.

## Test Files

### Footer.test.tsx

General functionality tests for the Footer component:

- Component renders without errors
- Displays fallback year and updates after mount
- Handles null year state gracefully
- Updates year correctly after component mounts
- Renders all contact information correctly
- Renders all quick links correctly
- Renders social media links with proper accessibility
- Renders privacy and terms links
- Has proper semantic structure

### Footer.hydration.test.tsx

Specific tests for hydration behavior:

- Prevents hydration mismatches by using useState and useEffect pattern
- Handles server-client rendering differences gracefully
- Maintains consistent DOM structure during hydration
- Uses proper React patterns to avoid hydration issues
- Displays year correctly across different time zones

## Key Testing Patterns

### Hydration-Safe Pattern Verification

The tests verify that the Footer component uses the correct hydration-safe pattern:

1. Initial state is `null` to prevent server-client mismatches
2. `useEffect` updates the year only on the client side
3. Fallback rendering handles the null state gracefully

### Requirements Coverage

The tests cover all requirements from the specification:

- **Requirement 1.1**: Footer displays current year without hydration mismatches
- **Requirement 1.4**: No console errors related to server-client mismatches
- **Requirement 2.2**: Component uses client-side only rendering for dynamic values

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all Footer tests
npm run test:run -- Footer

# Run specific test file
npm run test:run -- Footer.test.tsx
npm run test:run -- Footer.hydration.test.tsx

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test -- Footer
```

## Test Results

All tests pass successfully, confirming that:

- The hydration fix works correctly
- The component renders without hydration errors
- The year updates properly after component mounts
- Fallback behavior works as expected
- The component maintains proper accessibility and semantic structure
